## Description 

Full-stack development can often be overwhelming and daunting. Despite experiencing challenging moments in tech, there are always tutorials available to help you navigate through it. These tutorials have been written by developers of all skill levels and offer a bit of courage and insight to those who need it. 

The main objective of this project is to understand that developers do not always write code -- there are instances where they have to write *about* code. By creating a regex tutorial and breaking down each part of the expression, you can gain the ability to both teach and learn something new in this field.
